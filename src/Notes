Why not use local computers/ laptops to host the websites?

1) I have to keep laptop/computer on at all time
2) I have to make sure secure all the time
3) I have to make sure laptop/computer is always connected to the internet

For these reasons we use servers
    Always connected to power and high speed internet
    Special layers of physical security

    SDLC:
    1.BA requests the requirements from the client
        BA creates srs(software requirement specification) sometimes called brs(business requirement specifications)
    2.Architects will create the software design document
    3.Developers develop the code on local computers/ laptops once ready they run tests cases and once all the test
        cases are passed the they will request the IT department to deploy this code to the Dev server
    4.QA will request IT or devops team to the deploy the code on QA servers will verify the change and start testing it.
    5.If required application is deployed on performance and security servers
    6.Once everything is tested on QA server application is deployed on staging server
    7.Once testing is completed on staging it will be deployed on UAT Servers
    8.Production servers

Commands to build java projects
    Execute shell(Build)
    javac src/com/solar/Main.java
    cd src
    java com.solar.Main
    The code above called the class Main and executed the main method within

Commands for maven projects
configuration for automatic checking of changes in code
    git (source code management)
        use github clone path
        no need for anything else in that section
    Poll SCM (Build Triggers)
        * * * * * (five stars with a space in between each will ask jenkins to check for any changes once a minute)
    Goals and Options(Build)
        clean install -Dtest=SmokeRunner  -> this code will run the SmokeRunner runner from our code on jenkins console
