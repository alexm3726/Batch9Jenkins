Why not use local computers/ laptops to host the websites?

1) I have to keep laptop/computer on at all time
2) I have to make sure secure all the time
3) I have to make sure laptop/computer is always connected to the internet

For these reasons we use servers
    Always connected to power and high speed internet
    Special layers of physical security

    SDLC:
    1.BA requests the requirements from the client
        BA creates srs(software requirement specification) sometimes called brs(business requirement specifications)
    2.Architects will create the software design document
    3.Developers develop the code on local computers/ laptops once ready they run tests cases and once all the test
        cases are passed the they will request the IT department to deploy this code to the Dev server
    4.QA will request IT or devops team to the deploy the code on QA servers will verify the change and start testing it.
    5.If required application is deployed on performance and security servers
    6.Once everything is tested on QA server application is deployed on staging server
    7.Once testing is completed on staging it will be deployed on UAT Servers
    8.Production servers
